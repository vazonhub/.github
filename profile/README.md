# 🚀 Welcome to VAZON

**VAZON** is an open-source initiative building a universal price aggregator for major marketplaces (Wildberries, Ozon, AliExpress, etc.). Our mission is to help users find the **best deals** instantly—including shipping costs, discounts, and seller ratings—without manually checking multiple platforms.

## 🔥 Why We Exist
> We believe online shopping should be:
> - ✅ **Transparent**: One unified price from all platforms  
> - 📉 **Smart**: Historical price tracking to avoid overpaying  
> - 🔔 **Proactive**: Alerts when prices drop  

This is currently a **passion-driven MVP**, but with big ambitions!

- 💻 Code **for impact**, not profit (for now)  
- 🛍️ Want to **simplify life** for everyday shoppers
